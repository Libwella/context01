I've found a good article on design trends for 2014 to look out for. Very interesting read.
I like the browsers games (number 18) :) alot of time and effort into that.

hypothesis

that much of early web design was not very nice because there was limitations to typography and the ability to arrange
elements on a web page and so good designers steered clear of web design. Hence good designers werenâ€™t even attempting
to design on the web. So early web design was created by mediocre designers using limited resources and who were over
compensating for the lack of resources with gimmicks.
