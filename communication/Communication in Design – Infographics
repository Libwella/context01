Communication in Design – Infographics

http://visual.ly/history-of-infographics (01/02/14)

	The history of infographics is extremely important to how modern communication techniques have developed and improved over time. Some of the first infographics date back to “cave paintings from 30,000BC”, these depicted animals and other resources in the area, I’d hazard a guess to say that they would be used to signal danger too. This form of communication is especially important to how the human race as a whole work together as a group and achieve many amazing things. Personally, I don’t think one person can even begin to compare to what a team of people can do. So communication is extremely important to this.
	
	Jumping forward to modern history, William Playfair was one of the first people to use pie charts, bar charts, line charts, and histograms to represent the economy of England in 1786. After this the use of infographics in presentations became more popular, simply due to how effective they were at conveying information. In 1857 an English nurse used bar and pie charts to convince Queen Victoria to improve conditions in military hospitals. I think that this shows how powerful infographics can be when used in presentation of information, and I think this is not only due to the fact that some people can’t visualise information, but mainly because it’s simply the most effective way in displaying new, not before seen, information to a person. If you’re doing research on something and you already understand the topic, looking at just raw data will make sense to you, but showing a lot of numbers to someone who has never seen anything to do with what you’re presenting, they will lose interest if they don’t fully understand the data.

Here is something of interest, over 700 postcard sized wooden tablets have been found at Vindolanda in Northumbria, dating fron the first century AD.
What is most intersting is that whilst some of them are offical in matter, others are personal.

One is a birthday invitation:
"Claudia Severa to her Lepidina greetings.
On 11 September, sister, for the day of the celebration of my birthday,
I give you a warm invitation to make sure that you come to us,
to make the day more enjoyable for me by your arrival,
if you are present (?). Give my greetings to your Cerialis.
My Aelius and my little son send him (?) their greetings.
(2nd hand) I shall expect you, sister.
Farewell, sister, my dearest soul, as I hope to prosper, and hail.
(Back, 1st hand) To Sulpicia Lepidina, wife of Cerialis, from Severa."

This one made me laugh:
"Sollemnis to Paris his brother, very many greetings.
I want you to know that I am in very good health, as I hope you are in turn, you neglectful man,
who have sent me not even one letter.
But I think that I am behaving in a more considerate fashion in writing to you ... to you, brother, ... my messmate.
Greet from me Diligens and Cogitatus and Corinthus and I ask that you send me the names ...
Farewell, dearest brother (?).
(Back, 1st hand) To Paris ... of the 3rd Cohort of Batavians, from Sollemnis ..."

I feel the tone of the language is not that dissimilar to that of facebook and twitter.

I quite like that 2000 years ago we as human beings were as keen as we are now and had a real need to commit our personal
feelings to print and to let others know how we feel even though we may be some distance apart.
