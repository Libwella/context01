Communication in Design – Infographics

http://visual.ly/history-of-infographics (01/02/14)

	The history of infographics is extremely important to how modern communication techniques have developed and improved over time. Some of the first infographics date back to “cave paintings from 30,000BC”, these depicted animals and other resources in the area, I’d hazard a guess to say that they would be used to signal danger too. This form of communication is especially important to how the human race as a whole work together as a group and achieve many amazing things. Personally, I don’t think one person can even begin to compare to what a team of people can do. So communication is extremely important to this.
	
	Jumping forward to modern history, William Playfair was one of the first people to use pie charts, bar charts, line charts, and histograms to represent the economy of England in 1786. After this the use of infographics in presentations became more popular, simply due to how effective they were at conveying information. In 1857 an English nurse used bar and pie charts to convince Queen Victoria to improve conditions in military hospitals. I think that this shows how powerful infographics can be when used in presentation of information, and I think this is not only due to the fact that some people can’t visualise information, but mainly because it’s simply the most effective way in displaying new, not before seen, information to a person. If you’re doing research on something and you already understand the topic, looking at just raw data will make sense to you, but showing a lot of numbers to someone who has never seen anything to do with what you’re presenting, they will lose interest if they don’t fully understand the data.

Here is something of interest, over 700 postcard sized wooden tablets have been found at Vindolanda in Northumbria,
dating fron the first century AD.

What is most intersting is that whilst some of them are offical in matter, others are personal.

One is a birthday invitation:
"Claudia Severa to her Lepidina greetings.
On 11 September, sister, for the day of the celebration of my birthday,
I give you a warm invitation to make sure that you come to us,
to make the day more enjoyable for me by your arrival,
if you are present (?). Give my greetings to your Cerialis.
My Aelius and my little son send him (?) their greetings.
(2nd hand) I shall expect you, sister.
Farewell, sister, my dearest soul, as I hope to prosper, and hail.
(Back, 1st hand) To Sulpicia Lepidina, wife of Cerialis, from Severa."

This one made me laugh:
"Sollemnis to Paris his brother, very many greetings.
I want you to know that I am in very good health, as I hope you are in turn, you neglectful man,
who have sent me not even one letter.
But I think that I am behaving in a more considerate fashion in writing to you ... to you, brother, ... my messmate.
Greet from me Diligens and Cogitatus and Corinthus and I ask that you send me the names ...
Farewell, dearest brother (?).
(Back, 1st hand) To Paris ... of the 3rd Cohort of Batavians, from Sollemnis ..."

I feel the tone of the language is not that dissimilar to that of facebook and twitter.

I quite like that 2000 years ago we as human beings were as keen as we are now and had a real need to commit our personal
feelings to print and to let others know how we feel even though we may be some distance apart.

That's actually really cool. I agree that it's almost like the very first twitter! Whilst we're on a historical note;
Here's an article that timelines communication through the web, way back to 1969. It's interesting to see how much it's
progressed and how important it's become in peoples lives.

http://mashable.com/2011/01/24/the-history-of-social-media-infographic/ (This is just an infographic detailing the same info)

I was amazed at how fast the web took off. In 2005 there were 8 BILLION web pages, that's a huge number...
The very next year, 2006, there were 25 Billion web pages indexed by google that's more than doubled, in 1 year!

As a side note, here's a news article from 1995 Titled, "Why the Web Won't Be Nirvana" It's a really interesting and 
pretty funny read. It gives some perspective into the other side of society back during the birth of the web, not everyone
embraced it.

It's interesting to see alot of the things he listed as being "impossible for computers to do" Are actually
now fully in place and accepted as a regular part of life, like internet shopping, computers in school, eBooks and magazines
and government reports being uploaded online.


With the web now being so large and surpasing everyones expectations here are some good, and bad things that have
started to appear as a result of the social media boom;

I think that the article pays too much attention to "text speak" Anyone who's spent more than an hour on the internet
is fully aware of the monsoon of people just waiting to correct your grammar and pull you up if you don't speak properly.
I just think it's a common misconception that all kids speak in "text speak" because in my experience, it's the middle
aged people and people who haven't been brought up with the internet that excesively use text speak.

To put it into context, Both my parents born in the 70's, and grandparents born in the 40's, use social media and they
all use ALOT of 'text speak' whereas my younger relatives like my cousins, born in the late 80's and 90's go to lengths
to make sure they're using proper grammar and spelling. The entire reasoning behind text speak was to make texting on old
mobile phones easier back before every phone had a qwerty keyboard and you had to press the keys multiple times to type
one letter. The irony is, is that most of the kids that are apparently using text speak are too young to have even
experienced that. It's the older generation that were living and breathing the mobile phone boom.

After that little rant, here's another infographic that goes through some of the more positive aspects of social media
and what it helps us to acheive and how we use it.

I think some of the numbers here are pretty staggering, 89% of job recruiters have hired through Linkedin, 4 Billion
videos are watched every day on YouTube, 100,000 tweets are sent every minute. It helps to visualise the sheer scale
and power of the internet.

That's about all I've found up to now.
